## Multiple Approaches to solve the problem

### First approach

First approach is to traverse both the LinkedList and create a sumArray that holds the required
order of the resultant LinkedList

Using the Summation Array elements, create a new LinkedList with desired sequence

The approach is little naive and brute force, will optimize it once I revisit the linkedList DS
