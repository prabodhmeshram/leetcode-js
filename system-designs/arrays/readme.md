# Implement an Array

We'll implement an array using Object. It will have all the standard operations
push, pop. On top of it we'll introduce insert and remove method that will insert
or remove the elements within the array. These operations would be of Time Complexity
O(n) as these operations would result in not only affecting the array size and data,
but will rearrange the existing array after the operations
